    <!-- position fixed means the position is fixed and it counts from /is related to/  the document only 
        when scrolling it will not chage position but it will stay on the window/visual screen/ since its releated to the document.-->
    <!-- relative position means an element’s original position remains in the flow of the document,
           left/right/top/bottom/z-index will work but is stays in one position when scrolling doesnt change position-->
    <!-- static position means does not move even though we applyied right and top it does not move,
      every element has a static position by default refenece the body.top,right,bottom &left does not apply, 
        so the element will stick to the normal page flow. So if there is a left/right/top/bottom/z-index set
         then there will be no effect on that element-->
    <!--  absolute positioning,position the element relative to the document or parent element. 
      if you want to make it relative to the parent element, the parent element should have position property with value "relative".
      if its relative to the document then when srolling does not change position.
      element is removed from the flow of the document and 
            other elements will behave as if it’s not even there whilst all the other
             positional properties will work on it. To make the child element positioned
              absolutely from its parent element we need to set this on the parent element itself:-->
    <!-- sticky position  the element is treated like a relative value until the scroll location 
      of the viewport reaches a specified threshold, at which point the element takes a fixed 
      position where it is told to stick. better exlpain with "top:0px" style  -->

    <!-- inheritance-->
    <!-- if position:inherit is applied then the child will inherit the property position with value from the parent exept margin and padding-->
