        when scrolling it will not chage position but it will stay on the window/visual screen/ since its releated to the window.-->
    <!-- relative position, you can move the element relative to its original position with in the container, means an elementâ€™s original position remains in the flow of the document,
           left/right/top/bottom/z-index will work but is stays in one position when scrolling doesnt change position-->
    <!-- static position means does not move even though we applyied right and top it does not move,
      every element has a static position by default refenece the body.top,right,bottom &left does not apply, 
        so the element will stick to the normal page flow. So if there is a left/right/top/bottom/z-index set
         then there will be no effect on that element-->
    <!--  absolute positioning,position the element relative to the container or parent element. 
      if you want to make it relative to the parent element, the parent element should have position property with value "relative".
      the element is removed from the flow of its original container and is not part of the container or parent anymore.
      -->
    <!-- sticky position  the element is treated like a relative value until the scroll location 
      of the viewport reaches a specified threshold, at which point the element takes a fixed 
      position where it is told to stick. better exlpain with "top:0px" style  -->
