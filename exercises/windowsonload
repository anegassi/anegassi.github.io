windows on load is uesful when we put the js file inside a header of anywhere in the body 
where it is put before the full html page is rendered. since it will try to execute the js file 
and the dom element objects that are called from js file will not work since theyare notfully loaded.
ways to solve it
1,use windows on load and put all the js fle inside the function handlre for wiindow.onload
2, put all your js files inside functions that way when the js file is executed it doesnt 
directly try to access the dom objects.
3, unopbtrisive way of writing in the js file which is similar to number2
can also prevent dom objects from getting accesed

obtrusive  way means separating all the function calls and other js code from the html and
putting it separately in js file

collections could be thought of as array of objects.
the following return collections
element.getelementsbytag
elements.hasChildNodes()
